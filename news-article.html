    <p class="popular">The people of Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) join the world in mourning the death of international diplomat Kofi Annan
    who died in Switzerland at the age of 80 on August 18, 2018. Annan left a legacy of global peacemaking during international
    crises that defined the post-Cold War era. His peacekeeping efforts in Timor-Leste are often forgotten, but in the small
    coastal capital city of Dili, candles were lit for the former United Nations (U.N.) secretary-general who had negotiated
    peace in the nation following two decades of violent occupation from Indonesia that began in 1975. Timor-Leste is part of
    a Southeast Asian archipelago comprised of roughly one million people who gained independence from Indonesia in 1999 and
    joined the U.N. in 2002.
